# Background

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables researchers to compare the transcriptomes of individual cells and assess transcriptional similarities and differences within a population. This analysis is typically to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) and/or marker genes by comparing gene expressions in cell populations under various biological conditions, such as health and disease, and/or cell cluster annotation. The increased cost efficiency and throughput of scRNA-seq now make it feasible to sequence a larger number of samples. Data can be generated from samples comprising hundreds of subjects and millions of cells, making differential expression (DE) analysis more challenging. The key challenges include 1) correlation within subjects and cell populations and high variability between subjects and across cell populations, and 2) large scale of the data, consisting of hundreds of thousands to millions of cells. Mixed-effect models have been used to address the challenge of intra-subject correlation and inter-subject variability by modeling the subject as a random effect (@Dream2020, @nebula, @Zimmerman2021,  @MSMCSim2022). In multi-subject single-cell studies, it is not feasible to model subjects as a fixed effect when comparing individuals, where each subject is perfectly correlated with a specific condition of interest. Due to computational challenges, the performance of mixed-effects models for DE analyses has mostly been examined through simulation analyses with only small numbers of subjects and cells or pseudobulk methods.

To address the challenge of large-scale scRNA-seq in linear mixed-effects model (LMM) based DE analysis, we developed a fast and scalable LMM estimation algorithm and created an R package named scLMM, the single-cell (sc) analysis by a linear mixed-effects model (LMM). Our LMM estimation leverages summary statistics of the correlation relationship between the response matrix and design matrices as inputs, rather than using cell-level measurements directly. These summary statistics can be computed quickly in advance. Once computed, the LMM estimation computation is independent of the number of cells (sample size). Comparing to the standard LMM estimation method lmer in lme4 package [@lme4], our LMM algorithm is much fast and accurate, and requires significantly less computer memory. Importantly, by the scLMM, we can comprehensively examine the performance of LMM in the large scale single-cell data analysis. 

Our LMM estimation algorithm allows the parameters of variance components to be negative such that the variance-covariance matrix of observed response measurements is definable (positive definite). This avoids zero boundary problem in the hypothesis testing of zero variance components. Hence, the asymptotic property of maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) holds under regularity conditions, and then we can use z-statistic or t-statistic for hypothesis tests of fixed effects and variance components. If the parameters of variance components are negative or zero, this implies that the mixed model is miss-specified and no random effects should be included. 

We evaluated the performance of scLMM through simulation studies based on metrics: 1) the accuracy and computational efficiency of our LMM fitting algorithm, and 2) the type-I error rate and statistical power of the LMM-based DE analysis method. For the simulation studies, we developed a scRNA-seq simulator, named simuRNAseq, to generate a multi-subject multi-cell-type scRNA-seq data based on a negative binomial (NB) distribution. Our simulator is similar to muscat [@muscat2020] and GLMsim [@GLMsim2024] but different in the estimation of the NB parameters. Both muscat and GLMsim have limitations in scRNA-seq simulations. The muscat estimates the dispersion of NB distribution by edgeR package based on a subset of the reference data, which cannot be applied in a large scale scRNA-seq data and only reflects a partial information of the reference data. GLMsim estimates coefficients and dispersion parameter of the NB model for each gene by glm.nb in MASS package, which is time-consuming, and only generates a data with a fixed size as the reference data. Our simuRNAseq simulator computes the dispersion of NB distribution models by the method-of-moments estimate (MME) [@Clark1989], which is fast and flexible and uses a whole biological reference data. 

We demonstrated the application of scLMM for case-control comparisons in a tuberculosis immune atlas, cell-type-specific sex comparisons in healthy kidney datasets, and the identification of cell-type marker genes in both contexts. In summary, scLMM not only accelerates analysis in single-cell studies but also enhances accuracy across diverse biological contexts, paving the way for leveraging mixed models in large-scale, multi-subject single-cell data analysis.



# Results

## Overview of scLMM

scLMM package comprises the main functions: lmm, lmmfit and lmmtest. Both lmm and lmmfit functions are to fit LMM by restricted maximum likelihood (REML). The two functions are identical in LMM fitting but different in arguments. lmmfit directly uses response matrix and design matrices as arguments, while lmm uses summary statistics of correlation relationship between response matrix and design matrices as arguments. The summary statistics can be fast computed in advance. lmm doesnâ€™t depend on the sample size (the number of cells for scRNA-seq data) and needs much less computer memory in the single-cell DE analysis. lmmtest conducts t-tests for fixed effects and contrasts of the fixed effects. The scLMM workflow for the DE analysis is shown in Figure \ref{fig:scLMM}. See the LMM estimation and inference in Methods section and Supplemental Materials.

## Simulation studies

We validated the accuracy and computational efficiency of lmm and lmmfit by comparing to the standard method lmer in lme4 package [@lme4] based on simulated scRNA-seq data. We also evaluate the performance of lmm/lmmfit in single-cell DE analysis through simulations by criteria: (1) control of Type-I-error (False positive rate or FPR) and (2) statistical power (true positive rate or TPR) with comparing to the NEBULA [@nebula]. We developed a scRNA-seq simulator, named simuRNAseq, to simulate a multi-subject multi-cell-type scRNA-seq data, by using a reference data based on a negative binomial (NB) distribution, see the section of simulation methods in Supplemental Materials. The simuRNAseq simulator computes the dispersion of NB distribution models by the method-of-moments estimate (MME) [@Clark1989]. Compared to the maximum likelihood based estimates, such as glm.nb, the MME is computationally more simple and performs well. 

**Simulating scRNA-seq data**:
We used PBMC 10X droplet-based scRNA-seq data from lupus patients [@PBMC2018], as a reference to simulate scRNA-seq datasets with 6,000 genes and 6 sample sizes from 20,000 to 120,000 cells. The genes were randomly selected from the reference data, and the cells were simulated from 25 subjects and 12 cell-types treated with two conditions. The treatments, cell-types and subjects are assigned randomly with equal probability. There are 480 DE genes specific to a cell-type. 

**Accuracy and computational efficiency**:
We first validated the accuracy and computational efficiency of lmm and lmmfit using simulated datasets by comparing to the lmer in lme4 package [@lme4]. We fit the LMM to the log-transformed counts, $log(1 + counts)$, respectively, by lmm, lmmfit, and lmer with default setting. Note that the lmer in lme4 package doesn't provide p-values for hypothesis tests of coefficients. We refit the LMM by the lmer in lmerTest package [@lmerTest] to obtain the p-values in the lmer fitting. lmerTest package overloads lmer from lme4 package and extends output of the summary method from the lme4 package by adding degrees of freedom using the Satterthwaite's or Kenward-Roger's approximations for the t test and corresponding p values.

The differences of variance components, coefficients, and p-values between lmm and lmer are shown in Figure \ref{fig:lmer} (a). The model parameters (coefficients and variance components) in lmm and lmer fittings are identical up to the sixth digit. Note that the differences between lmm and lmer fittings can be further reduced by changing the control parameter in lmer to increase the accuracy of lmer fitting, but the lmer computation time will also increase. The computation time for running lmm, lmmfit and the lmer with default setting in a MacBook with 16GB memory is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lmer} (b). It is seen that lmm and lmmfit are much faster than lmer. lmmfit was about 50-fold to 140-fold faster than lmer as sample size increases from 20,000 to 120,000. lmm took much least time about 0.3 minutes and the time almost didn't change as sample sizes increases. The exact running times are listed in Supplemental Table.

**Performance in single-cell DE analysis**:
The QQ-plots of non-DE genes p-values and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves at sample size $n=120000$ for lmm and nebula are shown in Figure \ref{fig:lmer} (c) and (d). The nebula was run with arguments: method=â€˜LNâ€™ and model=â€˜NBLMMâ€™, the negative binomial lognormal mixed model that is used for simulating the data. The QQ-plots show that lmm has a good control of Type-I-error while nebula slightly deflates the p-values. The ROC curves show that lmm has a close power with nebula. The QQ-plots and ROC curves across various sample sizes are shown in Supplemental Figures. The scatterplots in Supplemental Figures also show that lmm and nebula t-values and p-values are coincident.

## DE analysis of biological scRNA-seq data

**Kidney scRNA-seq data**:
We first examined the sex variations within healthy kidney cell types using the kidney scRNA-seq data [citation]. The kidney data from 19 subject samples contains 22,484 genes and 27,677 cells consisting of 18 cell-types. After filtering in quality control process, the data contains 14,175 genes and 27,550 cells. We performed a differential expression analysis using scLMM to identify the DE genes between male and female within a cell-type with taking into account the subjects as a random effect. Among the various cell populations (types), we highlight the cortical thick ascending limb (cTAL) cells, which are the second most abundant cell type and exhibit 131 DE genes with FDR < 0.05 and logFC < -0.25 or > 0.25. The top DE genes in male and female cTAL cells are shown in Figure \ref{fig:kidneydeg} A and B. Pathway analysis of the top DE genes revealed enrichment of angiogenesis and vasculature development pathways in male cTAL cells, and cytoskeleton and filament assembly components in female cTAL cells, Figure \ref{fig:kidneydeg} C and D. 

For comparison, we also performed the DE analysis using the lmer with default setting. The differences between lmm and lmer fittings and computation time for lmm, lmmfit and lmer are shown in the Biological Data Analysis section of supplemental materials. The estimated model parameters (coefficients and variance components) in lmm and lmer fittings are identical up to at least the sixth digit. lmm is about 100-fold faster than lmer for fitting the kidney data.

**Tuberculosis (TB) scRNA-seq data**:
We then applied scLMM to single-cell transcriptomics data from 500K memory T cells from 259 donors in a tuberculosis (TB) progression cohort [@Nathan2021]. After quality control process, the large TB dataset contains 11,596 genes and 499,713 cells covering 29 cell states from 46 batches and 259 individual donors. The majority of the samples have been sequenced in a single batch. A few of them have been split into two batches. In the DE analysis, we modeled the donors as a random effect and ignored the batch effect because the majority of donors were sequenced in a single batch. We applied scLMM to identify genes associated with TB status within each cell state (cluster). scLMM identified a varying number of DE genes associated with TB progression across different cell states (FDR < 0.05 and logFC > 0). The top two cell types with the highest number of DE genes were the activated CD4+ and activated CD8+ populations (The numbers of DE genes: 1266 and 268, respectively; Figure \ref{fig:TBdeg}A). We further evaluated the TB-associated signatures within these two cell states, listing the top TB-enriched genes for activated CD4+ and CD8+ cells in Figure \ref{fig:TBdeg}B. Pathway analysis of these DE genes revealed enrichment of cell-cycle pathways in the CD4+ population and immune response, TCR-mediated T cell activation, and chemokine secretion pathways in the CD8+ cell state, Figure \ref{fig:TBdeg}C. 

The estimated model parameters (coefficients and variance components) in lmm and lmer fittings are identical up to at least the sixth digit. Notably, scLMM took about 1.4 hours of runtime on the 500K T cell dataset, whereas lmer spent 55.6 hours (2 days and 7.6 hours), see the Biological Data Analysis section in supplemental materials. This indicates that for large datasets, scLMM is the more viable option.

# Conclusion and discussion

We have developed a fast and scalable LMM estimation algorithm and created scLMM for large scale single-cell DE analysis. The simulation studies demonstrated that our LMM algorithm is both accurate and computationally efficient compared to the standard lmer method in the lme4 package. Our algorithm proved to be hundreds of times faster than lmer for the simulated scRNA-seq data with hundreds of thousands of cells. Our simulation studies verified that the LMM-based DE analysis method can effectively control false positive rate while maintaining high statistical power. Additionally, we applied scLMM to the large-scale tuberculosis dataset, demonstrating its ability to identify marker genes and facilitate group-based comparisons. 

Our LMM estimation algorithm leverages summary statistics rather than using cell-level measurements directly. These summary statistics can be computed quickly in advance. Once computed, the LMM estimation achieves a computational complexity of $O\{m(p^3 +q^3)\}$, which is independent of the sample size $n$ (the number of cells). In the DE analysis, the numbers of fixed and random effects, $p$ and $q$, are relatively small, and consequently the LMM algorithm is fast and requires significantly less computer memory. In the application with a large $q$, the LMM algorithm will become slow. In this case, we should first reduce the dimension of random effects by cluster analysis or principal component analysis (PCA), see Supplemental Materials for details. Due to the conditions of LMM estimability and overfitting, the number of fixed effects, $p$, is not allowed to be large. This is also why we should treat subjects and/or batches as random effects instead of fixed effects when these numbers are large.

Using scLMM, we can comprehensively examine the performance of LMM in the large-scale scRNA-seq DE analysis. For future work, a benchmark comparing LMM with cell-level counts, pseudobulk method with subject-level pseudobulk counts (@Zimmerman2021,  @MSMCSim2022), and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) based methods (e.g., NEBULA, @nebula) across various experimental settings could provide valuable insights. 

The mixed models have become powerful tools in data analysis due to the capability of modeling of the inter-subject variation and intra-subject correlation. scLMM is versatile and indicates potential application with other data modalities such as spatial data and multiomics. Its efficient mixed model framework, designed to handle complex hierarchical structures and correlations in single-cell RNA sequencing data, suggests it could effectively extend to these domains. Further exploration of scLMM's capabilities across diverse biological datasets holds promise for uncovering novel insights and enabling integrated analyses in broader research contexts.



# Methods

## LMM estimation and inference
Consider the linear mixed-effects model (LMM) as expressed below [@Searle2006]
\begin{equation} \label{lmm}
y = X\beta + Zb + \epsilon,
\end{equation}
where $y$ is an $n\times 1$ vector of observed responses (expressions for a gene) , $X$ is an $n\times p$ design matrix for fixed effects $\beta$, $Z$ is an $n\times q$ design matrix for random effects $b$, and $\epsilon$ is an $n\times 1$ vector of residual errors. The term of random effects may be a combination of various effects
$$
Zb = Z_1 b_1 + \cdots + Z_K b_K,
$$
where $Z=[Z_1,\ldots,Z_K]$, $b=[b^T_1,\ldots,b^T_K]^T$, $K$ is the number of the various random effects occurring in the data, and $Z_i$ is an $n\times q_i$ matrix. The superscript $T$ denotes a transpose of vector or matrix. The basic assumptions are as follows: (1) The design matrix $X$ is of full rank, satisfying conditions of estimability for the parameters; (2) The random vectors $b_i$ and $\epsilon$ are independent and follow a normal distribution, $b_i \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \sigma^2_i I_{q_i})$ and $\epsilon \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \sigma^2I_n)$. Here $\sigma^2_i$ and $\sigma^2$ are unknown parameters, called variance components, $\mathbf{0}$ is a vector or matrix of zero elements, and $I_n$ is an $n\times n$ identity matrix. The random effects reflect variations between groups (subjects) and correlations within groups (subjects). 

@HartleyRao1967 developed maximum likelihood (ML) method for estimation of the unknown fixed effects and variance components in the linear mixed-effects models. The ML method estimates all parameters of fixed effects and variance components together. @PattersonThompson1971 proposed a modified maximum likelihood procedure which partitions the data into two mutually uncorrelated parts, one being free of the fixed effects used for estimating variance components, called restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimators. The REML estimator is unbiased. The MLE of variance components is biased in general. Both methods are asymptotically identical for estimating variance components and identical for estimating fixed effects.

Estimating the variance components by either MLE or REML is a difficult numerical problem. Various iterative methods based on the log likelihood, called gradient methods, have been proposed [@Searle2006]. The gradient methods are represented by the iteration equation
\begin{equation}\label{gradient}
\theta^{(m+1)} = \theta^{(m)} + \Gamma(\theta^{(m)})\frac{\partial l(\theta^{(m)})}{\partial\theta},
\end{equation}
where $\partial l(\theta)/\partial\theta$ is the gradient of the log likelihood function, and $\Gamma(\theta)$ is a modifier matrix of the gradient direction, see the details in the Supplementary materials. 


**Fast and scalable algorithm**:
We developed a summary statistics based algorithm for implementing the gradient method \eqref{gradient}, which uses summary-level matrices, $X^TX$, $X^TZ$ and $Z^TZ$, to estimate LMM parameters instead of individual-level matrices, $X$ and $Z$, see the Supplementary materials. The algorithm has a complexity of $O(n(p^2 + q^2)+p^3+q^3)$. In single-cell DE analysis, the number of cells (sample size) $n$ is large while the numbers of fixed and random effects $p$ and $q$ are relatively small, e.g., less than hundreds. Thus the summary statistics based algorithm has a complexity of $O(n(p^2+q^2))$, linearly scalable with the sample size $n$. The summary statistics can be computed in advance. Once computed, the algorithm has a complexity of $O(p^3+q^3)$ that doesn't depend on the sample size $n$. So the algorithm is fast and requires less computer memory in the single-cell DE analysis. The algorithm can further speed up by reducing the dimension of random effects. For a large number of random effects, using cluster analysis or principal component analysis (PCA), we may combine the correlated random effects to reduce the dimension, see the Supplementary materials.


**Hypothesis testing**: 
The hypothesis testing for fixed effects and variance components can be respectively defined as
$$
H_{0, i}: \beta_i = 0 ~~\text{versus}~~H_{1,i}: \beta_i\ne 0,
$$
$$
H_{0, k}: \sigma^2_k = 0 ~~\text{versus}~~H_{1,k}: \sigma^2_k > 0.
$$
The variance components under null hypothesis, $\sigma^2_k=0$, are on the boundary of the parameter space, in which case the MLE asymptotic property is inappropriate. With reparameterizing the variance components, $\theta_k = \sigma^2\gamma_k$, the covariance matrix, $V_{\theta} = \sigma^2(I + \gamma_1Z_1Z_1^T + \ldots + \gamma_KZ_KZ_K^T)$, is positive-definite and well-defined when $\gamma_k > - 1/\lambda_{max}$, where $\lambda_{max} > 0$, is the largest singular value of $ZZ^T$. Now the parameters of variance components, $\theta_k$, can be negative. Then the hypotheses for the variance components are extended as
$$
H_{0, k}: \theta_k \le 0 ~~\text{versus}~~H_{1,k}: \theta_k > 0,
$$
in which the zero components, $\theta_k=0$, are no longer on the boundary of the parameter space and the MLE asymptotic properties hold. Then we can use z-statistic or t-statistic for hypothesis testing of fixed effects and variance components. The t-statistics for fixed effects are given by
\begin{equation}\label{tcoef}
T_i = \frac{\hat\beta_i}{\sqrt{var(\hat\beta_i)}} = \frac{\hat\beta_i}{\sqrt{var(\hat\beta)_{ii}}} ~\sim ~t(n - p),
\end{equation}
where $var(\hat\beta) = (X^TV_{\theta}^{-1}X)^{-1}$, is the covariance matrix of $\hat\beta$. The t-statistic for a contrast, a linear combination of the estimated fixed effects, $c^T\hat\beta$, is 
\begin{equation}\label{tcontrast}
T_c = \frac{c^T\hat\beta}{\sqrt{c^Tvar(\hat\beta) c}} \sim t(n-p).
\end{equation}
The z-statistics for the parameters of variance components are given by
\begin{equation}\label{zvarcomp}
Z_k = \frac{\hat\theta_k}{\sqrt{[I(\hat\theta)^{-1}]_{kk}}} \sim N(0, 1),
\end{equation}
where $I(\theta)$ is the Fisher information matrix. If $Z_k > 0$, then $\sigma_k^2 = \theta_k$ is definable and the mixed model is well-specified. Otherwise, if $Z_k \le 0$, the mixed model is miss-specified, that is, no random effects are needed.
